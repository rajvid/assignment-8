    <h2>FOUNDER</h2>
    <div class="flexbox">
      <div class="left">
        <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid
          and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States
          Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and  started
          Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery
          eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies
          came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people,
          especially young women, and the business has been booming ever since.</p>
